# The World Devourer
## The game
The Wolrd Devourer is a game developed for the Ludum Dare 42. The theme for this jam was "Running out of Space" which was, for us, a literal understand of what running out of space means. So, we decided to implemend a game with a top view of an alien monster, The World Devourer, that will run nonstop to eat his preys. When eating, the Devourer will grow up, increasing his length. The problem is that his natural habitat are caves in a unexplored World where humans just arrived.

## The World
This World, named TX002-RX, is one of the type AL world which means the world itself is a living form. The caves where our Devourer lives are alive and they can change the paths closing and opening them. The more the Devourer passes through a gate, the more probably will be it closes.
